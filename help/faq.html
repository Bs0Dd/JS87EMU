<h3>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> How to use the note book? Can not understand anything!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> Read the <a href="http://mk.bs0dd.net/mk87/mk-87_ins.djvu" target="_blank"><b>instruction manual</b></a> for the MK 87,
    it explains the principles of operation of the device's software (to be honest, it is quite counterintuitive). Unfortunately, there is only a Russian version of the manual,
    which makes it difficult for foreign users to understand. The translation of images does not provide 100% accuracy, so for simplicity,
    you can also study the manual of the "prototype" device - <a href="http://mk.bs0dd.net/mk87/pf3000.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Casio PF-3000</b></a>.
    While the MK87 lacks some features and there are some differences in the operation of the system,
    much of the MK87 documentation is clearly borrowed from the PF-3000 documentation.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does the message "** СБРОС! **" (Reset) appear on the note book screen for a few seconds when I first launch the emulator?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> When you first start the emulator, a clean RAM image is always created, which needs to be initialized.
    In MK 85, the initialization operation ("initial settings") is also performed, but if in a microcomputer it happens quickly,
    then in a note book it takes more time, so the user has time to notice the reset message, there is nothing wrong with that.

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> How to switch the case of letters in the notebook?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> No way. Unlike MK 85, the MK 87 character table only has capital Cyrillic letters, so even Latin letters cannot be used.
</p><br>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why can't I set more than 2KB of RAM for note book?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> Actually, it is possible, but it makes no sense, since the firmware is designed exclusively for 2KB RAM,
    so increasing the size will not have any effect. The book will still show that 1810 characters are available for entries.

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why can't I load ROM from a binary file into my notebook?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> The MK 85 has the ability to load ROMs because there are several versions of third-party ROMs developed by enthusiasts in the late 2000s.
    The MK 87 is a very rare device (compared to the 85), so it is unlikely that anyone would want to make a third-party ROM for it, especially since it is not a universal microcomputer.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does the reset button on the clock module set all values ​​to 11?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> According to the instruction, when resetting the watch, the following readings are set:
    11 hours, 11 minutes, 11 seconds, 11 day, 11 month, 11 year, day of the week - Monday.

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does the note book turn off after some time?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> The thing is that the note book has an automatic power-off system when it is not used for a long time.
    Switching off occurs according to a software-implemented timer that counts the time until switching off.
    Since the firmware never stops the processor clock generator (unlike the MK 85), the keyboard polling program is constantly running, which,
    if there is no key pressed, decreases the timer counter (when a key is pressed, the timer is reset).
    After approximately 3.5 minutes, the timer will run out and the device will automatically turn off due to prolonged inactivity.
